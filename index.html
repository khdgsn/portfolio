            <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Kathryn. Before COVID-19 I used to work as a swimming teacher but I now work as a DotCom picker in my local Tescos.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>In the summer of 2020 I decided a career change was for me, and decided to enrol to IT Career Switch.</p>
                <p>My journey has been fun, exciting, frustrating, rewarding, annoying and overall the best thing I have decided to do in a while.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>In my spare time I like to listen to audible, and practice coding.</p>
                <p>I have an interest in horses, my gerbils (Ahsoka and Leia), and catching up with my friends and family.</p>
                <p>I was actually bulding a website before I even realised I was interested in it as a career, scroll down for more details!</p>
